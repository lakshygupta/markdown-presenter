# Markdown Presenter

## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the ultimate guide for creating stunning presentations using markdown! This demo showcases how to transform simple markdown syntax into professional presentation slides.

### What is Markdown to PPT ?

Markdown to Presentation (mdppt) is a revolutionary way to create presentations using simple markdown syntax. No more wrestling with complex presentation software - just write in markdown and watch your content transform into slides!

Create your markdown file on your local system using any preferred text editor (such as Notepad, Visual Studio Code, or similar applications), then import it into mdppt to generate a professional, interactive presentation. ✨📝➡️🎯

This workflow maintains simplicity - develop locally, present professionally! 💻✍️

### Why Choose Markdown for Presentations ?

- **Simple Syntax**: Focus on content, not formatting
- **Portable**: Works anywhere markdown is supported
- **Fast**: Create presentations in minutes, not hours
- **Consistent**: Automatic styling ensures professional look

## 📚 How to Use

### Step 1: Write Your Content ✍️

Create a text file on your system and save it with `.md` at the end (like `my-presentation.md`)

### Step 2: Make Slide Titles 📝

- Use `#` for main slide titles
- Use `##` for smaller titles
- Your first `#` title becomes your presentation title

**Example:**

```

# My Presentation Title

# First Slide

This is the content of my first slide.

# Second Slide

This is the content of my second slide.

## Small Title

More content here.

```

### Step 3: Add Your Content 💭

Write your text under each title. You can use:

- **Bold text** (wrap words with `**`)
- _Italic text_ (wrap words with `*`)
- Bullet points (start lines with `-`)
- Numbers (start lines with `1.`, `2.`, etc.)

### Step 4: Add Images (Optional) 🖼️

- For online images: Copy the web address
- For your own images: Put them in the same folder as your presentation file

### Step 5: Import to mdppt 📤

1. Go to the mdppt website
2. Drag your `.md` file onto the page, OR click to select it
3. mdppt will parse your markdown file and create slides
4. If you have local images, upload your image folder when asked

### Step 6: Start Presenting 🎯

- Press the `p` key to start presentation mode
- Use arrow keys (← →) to move between slides
- Press `Esc` to exit presentation mode

### Quick Tips 💡

- Keep one main idea per slide
- Don't put too much text on one slide
- Test your presentation before showing it to others

That's it! You're ready to create presentations. 🚀
